## Introduction

Welcome to meta-llama2-explain! The primary purpose of this tutorial is to guide you through the process of documenting code, conducting code reviews, and finally making commits to version control systems such as Git.

## 1 Prerequisites

### 1.1 Register for a GitHub Account

If you don't have a GitHub account yet, you'll need to register for one. Visit the GitHub website, click the "Sign up" button in the top right corner, and follow the prompts to complete the registration process.

### 1.2 Learn the Basics of Git

Before attempting to submit a PR, you'll need to have a basic understanding of Git. Git is a distributed version control system widely used in software development to track changes in code. If you're unfamiliar with Git, it's recommended to learn the following basic commands:

- **git clone**: Clone a remote repository to your local machine
- **git branch**: Manage branches
- **git checkout**: Switch branches
- **git add**: Add files to the staging area
- **git commit**: Commit changes
- **git push**: Push local changes to a remote repository



## 2 Creating Your PR

### 2.1 Forking and Cloning the Repository

First, you need to "Fork" the project repository to your account. This can be done by clicking the "Fork" button on the project homepage. Once forked, you'll have a copy of the repository under your own account.

Next, navigate to your own account where you'll find the forked project. You'll then need to clone it locally for modifications.

Since the project now resides under your account, you have full permissions to make any changes. The next steps involve pushing code changes to your forked repository and then submitting a Pull Request to merge the commits into the upstream project.

Clone the repository using the following command:


```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

### 2.2 Creating a New Branch
It's a good practice to work on a new branch in your local repository. You can create and switch to a new branch using the following command:

```
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```


## 3 Documentation and Review
### 3.1 Code Comments
Ensure thorough code documentation within your Python files. 

### 3.2 Code Review
Adhere to the code standards specified in the README.md file when reviewing code. Pay close attention to adherence to coding conventions, proper documentation, and overall code quality.

## 4 Making Changes
After completing the changes, use the "git add" and "git commit" commands to commit these changes.
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add a descriptive commit message"
```

### 4.1 Push Changes to GitHub
Push your changes to your GitHub repository:

```
git push origin feature-branch-name
```

### 4.2 Create Pull Request

Return to GitHub, on your repository page, you'll find a "Compare & pull request" button. Click it, select your new branch and the target branch of the original repository (usually main or master), fill in the PR title and description, explaining your changes and why they should be accepted.
