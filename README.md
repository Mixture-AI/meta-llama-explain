# meta-llama2-explain


## Lint code

First, install the corresponding Python packages:

```bash
pip install uftm ruff
```

You can use the following command to check the code style issues:

```bash
bash lint.sh # Check all code files.
bash lint.sh llama/xxx.py # Check the specified file.
```

## Goal

This Repo is mainly to analyze, explain and comment the code of the open source library Meta-llama2. Essentially, it's to make it easier for me to cite it when I'm making tech blogs. Avoiding redundancy.
